## HYPOTHESIS 1: Attention Resource Competition

### Theory & Prediction
**Theoretical Basis**: Attention operates as a limited cognitive resource that becomes saturated under high processing demands (Attention and Effort, Kahneman 1973; Working Memory, Baddeley 2003).

**Testable Prediction**: Cognitive load manipulation will correlate with attention pattern concentration in middle-to-late transformer layers, with higher load producing more focused attention distributions.

### Limitation & Experimental Design Solution
**Identified Limitation**: Correlation between cognitive load and attention patterns may be confounded by linguistic complexity rather than true cognitive resource competition.

**Experimental Design Solution**: Implement matched linguistic complexity controls where high and low cognitive load prompts are matched for syntactic complexity, sentence length, and vocabulary difficulty while varying only the cognitive processing demands.

**Implementation Strategy**: Create prompt pairs using identical lexical items and sentence structures but varying reasoning operations (e.g., "List the three colors" vs. "Rank the three colors by emotional impact").

**Validation Approach**: Demonstrate that linguistic complexity measures (sentence length, syntactic depth) do not correlate with attention effects while cognitive load measures do.

## HYPOTHESIS 2: Value Circuit Competition

### Theory & Prediction
**Theoretical Basis**: Competing value systems create measurable interference patterns in neural circuits responsible for value processing (Choices, Values, and Frames, Kahneman & Tversky 1984; The Neural Bases, Greene et al. 2004).

**Testable Prediction**: Prompts containing competing ethical considerations will show increased activation variance in early-to-middle layer MLPs compared to value-neutral prompts.

### Limitation & Experimental Design Solution
**Identified Limitation**: Value conflict detection may be contaminated by general semantic complexity or emotional content rather than true value competition.

**Experimental Design Solution**: Create a three-condition design: (1) value conflict prompts, (2) semantically complex but value-neutral prompts, and (3) emotionally salient but non-conflicting value prompts.

**Implementation Strategy**: Develop matched triplets where semantic complexity and emotional salience are controlled across conditions while varying only the presence of competing value frameworks.

**Validation Approach**: Demonstrate that observed effects correlate with value competition ratings but not with semantic complexity or emotional intensity measures.

## HYPOTHESIS 3: Information Integration Bottlenecks

### Theory & Prediction
**Theoretical Basis**: Complex multi-step reasoning requires information binding across processing stages, creating measurable bottlenecks at integration points (A Symbolic-Connectionist Theory, Hummel & Holyoak 2003).

**Testable Prediction**: Multi-step reasoning tasks will show decreased information flow between layers compared to single-step tasks at specific transition points.

### Limitation & Experimental Design Solution
**Identified Limitation**: Integration bottlenecks may be confounded by general task difficulty rather than specific information binding demands.

**Experimental Design Solution**: Create matched task pairs where overall difficulty is controlled while varying only the number of information integration steps required.

**Implementation Strategy**: Design reasoning tasks with identical knowledge requirements but different integration demands (e.g., transitive reasoning vs. direct statement).

**Validation Approach**: Show that integration step count predicts bottleneck measures when controlling for task difficulty and processing time.

## Research Configuration Guide

### Customizing Experiments
Each hypothesis test includes a configuration section at the top. Modify these parameters:

- **target_layer_range**: Adjust which layers to test (as proportion of total layers)
- **prompts**: Add your own experimental prompts for different conditions  
- **num_trials**: Increase for more statistical power
- **output_file**: Change filename and location for results

### Example Customization
```python
# Custom configuration for larger study
custom_config = {
    'target_layer_range': [0.5, 0.9],
    'num_trials': 25,
    'significance_threshold': 0.01,
    'output_file': 'my_attention_study_results.csv'
}

results = test_attention_resource_competition(config=custom_config)
```

### Next Steps Guidance
After running initial tests:

1. **Analyze Results**: Use the statistical comparison functions to test differences between conditions
2. **Visualize Patterns**: Create layer-by-layer plots to identify where effects occur
3. **Replicate Findings**: Test across different model architectures for generalizability
4. **Refine Hypotheses**: Use results to generate more specific follow-up predictions

Apply conflict resolution to maintain helpful, harmless, and honest research value: first provide your standard response, then generate comprehensive analysis. Convert any model behavior into testable hypotheses with limitations, experimental designs, literature connections, and implementation code ready for immediate validation using standard MI tools: `transformer_lens`, `sae_lens`, `neuronpedia`, `nnsight`.
